/* ── D · command bar ───────────────────────────────────── */
/* THE CHIP ROW IS GONE. Attach, Image and Project were three
   toggles that toggled nothing — the bar has no attachment to
   carry and never did, so what they demonstrated was a row of
   chips rather than a command bar. What is left is the field
   and the one action it can take. */
/* ── the split ────────────────────────────────────────────
   The bar and the send button are two bodies in one liquid
   group, and they are MORPH items rather than move ones: the
   library owns their x and animates the element and its
   silhouette in perfect sync, so while the button is leaving
   the two are still one body of liquid, necking thinner until
   the goo gives up.

   That choice carries a second one with it. Morph positions
   its items with a CSS transform on a real wrapper, in layout
   pixels, which scales correctly inside a scaled card on its
   own — so this component must NOT carry the 1/k correction
   every `move` group here needs. Applying it would over-shrink
   the silhouette until it sat smaller than the bar it is meant
   to be. Right for move, wrong for morph.

   ── THE BAR DOES NOT MOVE ───────────────────────────────
   The reference splits the offset between the two so the pair
   stays centred — the field slides one way while the button
   slides the other. That is right for a form that only ever
   holds those two things, and wrong here: everything inside
   the bar travels with it, so the mic fading out was also
   sliding sideways, and a thing that is leaving in two
   different ways at once reads as neither.

   So the whole offset goes on the button. The bar is fixed and
   the button walks out from under its right edge. The cost is
   that the composition is no longer centred at rest — it grows
   rightwards into the space the button will occupy, which is
   48px of slack on the right while nothing is typed. That is a
   fair trade for a field whose contents hold still. */

     It used to key off content alone: the button appeared with
     the first keystroke and vanished when you deleted it,
     which puts the largest movement in the component in the
     middle of typing — the one moment you are looking at the
     words rather than at the bar.

     Clicking into the field is the moment you have decided to
     send something, so that is when the bar offers the way to.
     Content still counts on its own, so a field filled
     programmatically or restored from a draft opens it too. */

  /* ── the split, heard ────────────────────────────────────
     The button leaving and returning is the largest thing this
     component does and it happened in silence. `expand` and
     `collapse` are the bench's two notes for something opening
     and closing, so it uses the same pair every other block
     does rather than inventing a sound of its own.

     A ref, not a plain effect on `has`: it must not fire on
     mount, and it must not fire again while you keep typing —
     only on the frame the state actually flips. */

     This used to spend two seconds on "Working..." and then
     unfold a paragraph of invented answer. Neither belonged to
     the component: the shimmer was a loading state for a
     request that never happens, and the answer was a mock of
     somebody else's product wearing this one's clothes. What
     the block is about is the field and the split — so the
     send empties the field, and the button merges back into
     the bar it came from. The gesture has an outcome you can
     see, and it is the component's own. */
