/* ── one spring, for everything that settles ───────────────
   The maths was already on this bench twice, copied by hand:
   Humidity's wheel and Brightness's column both accumulate
   velocity toward a target, damp it, and snap when both the
   delta and the velocity fall under 0.02. Two copies is a
   coincidence; five would be a policy, so it comes out here
   before the elastic blocks are written against it.

   The two shipped copies are deliberately NOT refactored onto
   this. They work, they are tuned, and rewriting the innards
   of two live components to prove a point about duplication
   is how a good afternoon becomes a bad one. This is the one
   new code uses.

   Frames, not milliseconds. `dt` is expressed in sixtieths of
   a second and the damping is RAISED to it rather than
   multiplied by it, so a dropped frame decays the same amount
   of energy as the two frames it replaced. Multiplying is the
   version that makes a spring behave differently on a busy
   page, which is the hardest kind of bug to see.

   The loop parks itself the moment the value has settled.
   CLAUDE.md is not complimentary about the one permanent
   requestAnimationFrame already on this bench and there is no
   case for five more. */

/* ══ Magnetic select ═══════════════════════════════════════
   A cluster of options set close enough together to be in
   each other's way, and a selection that behaves like a
   magnet rather than a highlight: the one you press swells
   and takes the ink, and the rest are shoved radially out of
   its way — hardest next to it, barely at all at the edges.

   THE POINT IS THE FIELD, NOT THE ITEM. A normal segmented
   control moves an indicator and leaves the layout alone,
   which is why selecting in one feels like bookkeeping. Here
   the choice deforms its neighbourhood, so the answer to
   "which one is selected" is legible from three feet away
   with the shapes unreadable — it is the one everything else
   is leaning away from.

   ── AND IT IS A GROUP, NOT A ROW ─────────────────────────
   It was a row first, and a row wastes the idea. In a line
   there are two directions to be pushed and both of them are
   the same direction, so the field can only ever read as
   spacing; the falloff has to be inferred from how far along
   the row you are. In a cluster the shove is a VECTOR — each
   chip goes the way it actually lies from the magnet — and
   the same arithmetic suddenly reads as a field, because you
   can see it acting on every bearing at once.

   Every number still falls out of ONE decision: how far the
   selected chip grows. The room it needs is arithmetic from
   that, the shove is that room plus an aura, the aura decays
   with real distance, and the tilt is the aura's leftovers. */

/* ── the options ───────────────────────────────────────────
   Pictures, and deliberately not icons. They were nine lucide
   shapes — a circle, a square, a triangle — chosen because a
   set of tools or weather states invites you to read the row
   instead of watching it, and this block has exactly one thing
   to show.

   Colour fields do that job better than outlines did. A shape
   at 19px is a thin mark in the middle of a 44px disc and most
   of the chip is empty; a picture IS the chip, so the cluster
   reads as seven objects rather than as seven containers with
   marks in them — and the field pushing them about has
   something to push.

   Inlined by scripts/marks.sh for the reason every picture on
   this bench is: the artifact bundle is one file and a linked
   image is a dead square the moment it leaves this machine.
   The FILE ORDER is the cluster order, so renaming them
   rearranges the component and nothing else has to know. */

/* ── the packing ───────────────────────────────────────────
   A hex lattice at a pitch of 48 against a 44 chip, so every
   neighbour sits 4px off touching and the cluster is as tight
   as it can be without the field having nowhere to push.

   THE REGULARITY IS THE POINT, and it is a reversal. These
   were hand-jittered before, on the reasoning that a lattice
   reads as a grid — true when the arrangement is the thing you
   are looking at, and wrong here, because the arrangement is
   the thing being DEFORMED. A field distorting an irregular
   scatter is hard to read as anything but a different
   scatter; the same field opening a hole in a honeycomb is
   unmistakable. You need the regular ground to see the
   disturbance against.

   ── AND THERE ARE TWO OF THEM, not a slider from four to
   nine. Every count between them was a worse version of one of
   these: five and six are a flower with a bite out of it,
   eight and nine are a flower with something stuck to the
   side. Three is a triangle and seven is the closed hexagon —
   the only two arrangements at this pitch where every chip has
   the same relationship to its neighbours, and the only two
   worth offering. A slider across six stops invited a drag to
   find the good one; there are two, so they are named.

   Points are taken from the lattice in rings outward, so each
   is the roundest blob available at that size, and the first
   is the centre — pressing a chip with neighbours on
   every side is the single best frame this component has, and
   the one the card should be caught in. Six is the default
   because it is a centre with a ring that is one short of
   closing: the notch keeps it from reading as a logo. */

   1.4 for as long as the chips were far enough apart not to
   care, and the tight packing is what set the real number.

   THE TIGHTEST PAIR IS NEVER BESIDE THE MAGNET. It is two
   chips on the same ray out of it — the near one shoved
   harder than the one behind it, so the pair closes by the
   difference between their pushes, and with 4px of slack
   there is nothing to absorb that. Measured at full Pull with
   1.4: every other pair in the cluster sat above 11px and
   that one was at 0.8, which is not overlapping and is well
   inside the margin where rounding could make it so.

   1.8 fixed it at a pitch of 48. At 46 — chips two pixels off
   touching — the same pair came back to exactly zero, because
   there is now almost no rest gap for the closing to eat.
   2.8 with a deeper cower is the answer: the field reaches a
   little further, which if anything reads as more of a field,
   and the chip the magnet is nearest gives up more of its own
   size. Both leave the PACKING alone, which is the point —
   the tightness is the resting picture and the clearance has
   to come from somewhere else. At a pitch of 45 the same pair

  /* ── AND EACH ONE LEANS TOWARD THE CURSOR ───────────────
     The field is what a chip does about the SELECTION. This is
     what it does about your hand: come within reach of one and
     it tips a few pixels your way, and lets go as you leave.

     A few pixels is the whole specification. Past about seven
     a chip stops acknowledging you and starts being something
     you are dragging, which is a different component. Same
     ceiling and the same curve the search field uses, because
     it is the same gesture and they should feel identical.

     AND IT IS THE GROUP THAT LEANS, not the chip. Tipping one
     disc on its own opens a gap on the side it came from and
     closes one on the side it went to — so a cluster packed a
     pixel off touching came apart wherever your cursor was.
     The spacing here is the whole picture; it has to survive
     being touched. Every chip moves by one shared vector: the
     group tips toward you as one body and the gaps are exactly
     what they were.

     ── AND THE VECTOR IS MEASURED FROM ONE POINT ───────────
     It was measured from whichever chip the cursor was nearest,
     which gave a group with seven possible origins. Crossing
     from one chip's territory to the next swapped the origin
     and the direction snapped with it, so moving over the
     cluster made it jerk about — worst in the middle, where
     the nearest chip changes every few pixels.

     One origin, the cluster's own centre, and the whole thing
     goes away: there is nothing to hand over to. It also means
     nothing here knows where the individual chips ARE, which
     is the honest shape for a behaviour that belongs to the
     group — the spaces between them stop being a thing the
     lean can notice.

     The magnitude RAMPS UP from the centre rather than peaking
     there, which is the other half of the same problem. Toward
     a point, the direction is whatever it is; AT the point it
     is nothing at all — so a lean that is strongest where its
     own direction is undefined spins on the spot. Zero at the
     centre, full at the cluster's edge, easing out past it.

     Measured from the chips' own resting geometry rather than
     from their rects. Reading a position off a thing this
     displaces is a feedback loop — it settles, but it settles
     by ringing, and on a 44px disc the ring is visible. The

                buys the hover its own curve, which it needs,
                since the spring that moves the field would
                make a bouncy hover out of a lift that is meant
                to be felt rather than seen. */}
            {/* ── the lean lives HERE, not on the button ────
                The button's transform is Framer's — the field's
                shove, the swell and the tilt, all on one spring
                with a delay on it. A cursor-follow on that
                spring would arrive late and keep arriving after
                you had gone. The skin is the other element and
                carries its own transform, which is also where
                the hover swell already lives. */}
