/* ══ One-time code ════════════════════════════════════════
   Six small cells and a caret. Digits rise into their cells;
   a right code draws the cells together until they fuse into
   one capsule that says so, and a wrong one sends a shiver
   down the row and drains the digits out.

   ── SIX CELLS, ONE FIELD ────────────────────────────────
   The same call the sign-in sheet makes, for the same reasons:
   six real inputs break paste, autofill from the notification,
   backspace and screen readers. So there is one invisible
   input over the row and the cells are drawn underneath it.

   ── THE MERGE IS THE GOO'S ──────────────────────────────
   The cells sit under a blur-and-threshold filter, far enough
   apart that it never bridges them. Verifying slides them to
   the middle while a capsule grows out of the same point: as
   they close, the filter joins them, and what is left is one
   shape. Nobody draws the in-between — it is the filter
   deciding when two things are close enough to be one.

   ── THE ANSWER IS A KNOB ────────────────────────────────
   A code nobody on the wall can know is not a demonstration.
   Accept and Reject are the two things the component does
   with a full row, so the panel picks which one you see. */

/* ══ liquid ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
   Shared parts for the Framer Motion layer: one spring, one
   goo filter, one velocity→skew binding.

   ── why the filter is a hook ────────────────────────────
   The filter is embedded in each component's own return, but
   its id CANNOT be a literal. Every block here renders twice
   at once — once in the wall card, once in the detail overlay
   — and duplicate SVG ids do not scope, they collide: the
   second instance silently steals the first one's filter.
   useId() gives each mount its own name.

   ── what the goo can and cannot do ──────────────────────
   This is feGaussianBlur + feColorMatrix, not a shader. The
   matrix multiplies alpha by `cut` and subtracts half of it,
   so alpha below 0.5 lands on zero and everything above 0.536
   is fully opaque. That hard edge is what fuses nearby shapes
   into one blob — and it is also why this must never touch
   text: glyph antialiasing lives entirely below 0.5, so type
   under this filter loses its edges and then itself. */

     a url(#…) reference, so strip the colons. */

/* ── inlined from lab/spring ──────────────────────── */
/* ── one spring, for everything that settles ───────────────
   The maths was already on this bench twice, copied by hand:
   Humidity's wheel and Brightness's column both accumulate
   velocity toward a target, damp it, and snap when both the
   delta and the velocity fall under 0.02. Two copies is a
   coincidence; five would be a policy, so it comes out here
   before the elastic blocks are written against it.

   The two shipped copies are deliberately NOT refactored onto
   this. They work, they are tuned, and rewriting the innards
   of two live components to prove a point about duplication
   is how a good afternoon becomes a bad one. This is the one
   new code uses.

   Frames, not milliseconds. `dt` is expressed in sixtieths of
   a second and the damping is RAISED to it rather than
   multiplied by it, so a dropped frame decays the same amount
   of energy as the two frames it replaced. Multiplying is the
   version that makes a spring behave differently on a busy
   page, which is the hardest kind of bug to see.

   The loop parks itself the moment the value has settled.
   CLAUDE.md is not complimentary about the one permanent
   requestAnimationFrame already on this bench and there is no
   case for five more. */
