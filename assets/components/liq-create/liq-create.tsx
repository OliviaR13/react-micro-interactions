/* ══ Liquid ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
   Three metaball studies: a toggle, a reorderable list, and
   a create menu.

   RECONSTRUCTED. The original file was destroyed; this is
   rebuilt against the surviving stylesheet, which specifies
   the geometry, the layering and the timing exactly. The
   behaviour matches what index.css and the catalog demos
   require. The original's internal reasoning is not
   recoverable and is not reproduced here.

   ── the shared constraint ───────────────────────────────
   Everything on a filtered layer must be OPAQUE. The goo
   filter thresholds alpha, so a translucent fill under it
   disappears. That is why each of these has two layers: an
   opaque blob layer that carries the filter, and an unfiltered
   layer above it carrying the text — antialiased type would
   be eaten by the same threshold. */

/* ── inlined from lab/motionkit ──────────────────────── */
/* ══ liquid ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
   Shared parts for the Framer Motion layer: one spring, one
   goo filter, one velocity→skew binding.

   ── why the filter is a hook ────────────────────────────
   The filter is embedded in each component's own return, but
   its id CANNOT be a literal. Every block here renders twice
   at once — once in the wall card, once in the detail overlay
   — and duplicate SVG ids do not scope, they collide: the
   second instance silently steals the first one's filter.
   useId() gives each mount its own name.

   ── what the goo can and cannot do ──────────────────────
   This is feGaussianBlur + feColorMatrix, not a shader. The
   matrix multiplies alpha by `cut` and subtracts half of it,
   so alpha below 0.5 lands on zero and everything above 0.536
   is fully opaque. That hard edge is what fuses nearby shapes
   into one blob — and it is also why this must never touch
   text: glyph antialiasing lives entirely below 0.5, so type
   under this filter loses its edges and then itself. */

/* the elastic, as specified: ζ = 14 / (2·√(220·0.5)) ≈ 0.67,
   so it overshoots about 6% before it settles. A deliberate
   bounce, not a wobble. */

  type: "spring" as const,
  stiffness: 220,

};

/* Non-drag blocks reuse the same feel without the overshoot,
   so a toggle does not bounce like a dragged card. */
/* ── the same liquid, without the overshoot ────────────────
   For shapes whose corner radius is animating: a spring that
   passes its target drags the radius past it too, and corners
   that dip under and come back read as a wobble rather than
   as a bounce.

   NOT just LIQUID with more damping, which is what this was.
   Raising damping alone to 30 against the same stiffness put
   ζ at 1.43 — comfortably overdamped, so it stopped
   overshooting by creeping: about 470ms to settle, against
   LIQUID's 290ms. It read as slow because it was.

   Stiffness comes up with the damping instead, which holds ζ
   at 1.03 — no overshoot, and it lands in about 180ms. */

/* ══ 3 · Create ═══════════════════════════════════════════
   One shape, and no filter on it — the other studies fuse two
   or more shapes, this has exactly one, so a blur could only
   damage it. The liquid here is entirely in the timing: the
   press sinks, and the spread starts while the sink is still
   running so there is never a still frame.

   it belongs in the panel rather than merely sitting in one —
   and the shut pill is a 38px button, so 19 is round for it.

   One knob moves all three because they are one relationship:
   turn it down and the panel, the pill and the rows square off

     .crt-say clips whatever it cannot fit, so this width being
     even slightly short takes the right edge off the last
     letter — and it was short two different ways.

     The rounding: offsetWidth is an integer and the label is
     not. "Create" measures 42.46 and comes back 42. The +1 is
     the fix; the error is always under a pixel so a pixel
     always covers it, and the pill is centred on the label so
     the spare costs nothing.

     The race, which is the one that made it intermittent: a
     layout effect runs before a webfont has swapped in, so on
     a cold cache this measured "Create" in the FALLBACK face
     and then froze that number for good. Warm cache measured
     Inter and looked fine — same code, different result, which
     is why it only cut the word sometimes. So measure again

         a moment later by a neighbour's, and the rest of its

         there.

         265x208. Everything in between is stage, so every
         press in it counted as a press on the menu and did
         nothing: measured at 48px of dead ground above the
         panel and 49 below, which is why closing it meant
         clicking well clear of the block rather than just off
         the menu.

         Geometry rather than containment, because the thing

         points at and there is no node covering only it — the
