/* ── inlined from lab/spring ──────────────────────── */
/* ── one spring, for everything that settles ───────────────
   The maths was already on this bench twice, copied by hand:
   Humidity's wheel and Brightness's column both accumulate
   velocity toward a target, damp it, and snap when both the
   delta and the velocity fall under 0.02. Two copies is a
   coincidence; five would be a policy, so it comes out here
   before the elastic blocks are written against it.

   The two shipped copies are deliberately NOT refactored onto
   this. They work, they are tuned, and rewriting the innards
   of two live components to prove a point about duplication
   is how a good afternoon becomes a bad one. This is the one
   new code uses.

   Frames, not milliseconds. `dt` is expressed in sixtieths of
   a second and the damping is RAISED to it rather than
   multiplied by it, so a dropped frame decays the same amount
   of energy as the two frames it replaced. Multiplying is the
   version that makes a spring behave differently on a busy
   page, which is the hardest kind of bug to see.

   The loop parks itself the moment the value has settled.
   CLAUDE.md is not complimentary about the one permanent
   requestAnimationFrame already on this bench and there is no
   case for five more. */

/* 0..100 into the two numbers a spring actually has.

   50 is what Humidity and Brightness were tuned at, which is
   the rule every elastic knob on this bench follows — see
   lab/motion. Turn the panel to the middle and nothing has
   changed.

   Both ends have to be usable, which is what fixes the range:
   at 0 it is slow and heavy and still arrives, at 100 it is
   quick with a visible overshoot, and nowhere in between does
   it ring for longer than it takes to read. */
/* The pair is chosen by DAMPING RATIO and then written back
   as stiffness and decay, because the ratio is the thing a
   person is actually setting and the two numbers on their own
   do not say what they add up to.

     zeta = -ln(d) / (2 * sqrt(k))

   The first version of this ran 0.06..0.26 stiffness against
   0.93..0.74 decay, which reads as a sensible spread and is
   not one: it puts zeta between 0.15 and 0.16 across the
   WHOLE range, so every setting overshot by about sixty per
   cent and the knob only changed how fast it did it. Pull's
   return went 130px past its own resting position and lifted
   the content off the top of the card.

     0   → zeta ~0.85, heavy, arrives without a ring
     50  → zeta ~0.41, near where Humidity and Brightness sit
     100 → zeta ~0.20, lively, two visible rebounds

/* ══ Action node ══════════════════════════════════════════
   A card for one step of an automation, with its controls
   folded into the corner until you want them.

   THE CONTROLS ARE THE COMPONENT. Everything else here — the
   mark, the name, the row of faces, the line about what it
   does — is a node card, and a node card is not an
   interaction. What this block is
   about is where a card's actions live when you are not using
   them, and the answer it argues for is: inside the corner
   they belong to.

   ── THEY COME OUT OF THE CORNER, THEY DO NOT ARRIVE AT IT ─
   The reflex is to fade a toolbar in above the card, and it
   is wrong in a way that is easy to miss: a control that
   fades in has no relationship to the thing it controls. It
   could belong to anything. These are drawn on an arc struck
   from the card's own top-right corner, they start AT that
   corner with no radius and no size, and they travel out
   along it — so the card is visibly where they came from and
   the corner is visibly what they are attached to.

   Which is also why they scale as they travel rather than
   arriving full size: a thing coming out of somewhere is
   small when it is still mostly inside it.

   ── ONE SPRING EACH, AND THE STAGGER IS A DELAY ON THE
      TARGET, NOT AN EASE ─────────────────────────────────
   Four springs, always constructed, because hooks cannot be
   conditional — the count knob decides how many are drawn,
   not how many exist. Each one is told to open a beat after
   the one before it, and the spring does the rest: the
   cascade is four objects with their own physics rather than
   one animation with offsets, which is the difference between
   a fan opening and a list appearing in order.

   Closing runs the other way, last out first back, so the
   fan folds into the corner rather than collapsing from the
   inside. */

const clamp = (v: number, lo: number, hi: number) => Math.min(hi, Math.max(lo, v));

/* the button and half of it. Everything else that has a size

/* ── they ride the card's OWN corner, offset ───────────────
   The path is the card's outline pushed out by a constant
   distance: straight along the top edge, round the corner on
   an arc concentric with it, straight down the right edge.
   Buttons are placed by how far along that path they are.

   ── WHY NOT A CIRCLE STRUCK FROM ONE POINT ──────────────
   That is what this was, with the centre parked 26px inside
   the corner, and it only looked right at one corner radius —
   the 18 it was tuned against. Square the card off and the
   card's material comes out to meet a path that has not
   moved: measured at Corner 0, the middle button cleared the
   corner by 2px while the ones at the ends of the fan still
   had thirteen. Round it right up and the opposite happens.

   A circle also cannot go round more than the quarter between
   the two edges. Past that the buttons carry on rotating away
   from an edge that has stopped curving, and a wide fan put
   its end buttons THROUGH the card's top edge.

   An offset path has neither problem because it is the card's
   own shape: every point on it is exactly `gap` from the
   nearest card surface, corner or edge, at every radius.

   ── how far along the path a button sits ────────────────
   `s` is arc length measured from where the corner arc meets
   the top edge, so the corner occupies 0..len and anything
   outside that has run onto a straight. Returns the point and
   the direction out of the card there, which is what the
   button slides along when it opens. */
function ride(s: number, corner: number, off: number) {
  /* the offset arc is concentric with the card's, so its
     radius is the card's plus the offset — and floored just
     above zero for a square card, where the corner is a

/* ── where they hide, and it has to be PROVABLY inside ─────
   A point on the card's diagonal, far enough in that a whole
   button fits behind the card with nothing showing past the
   corner.

   It cannot simply be "back along the normal", which is what
   it was: a button over the top edge slid down behind the
   top edge fine, but the one sitting on the corner slid back
   toward a corner that, when Corner is 0, has no material in
   the diagonal to hide behind. Measured at Corner 1, four
   pixels of every folded button showed past the point.

   Two cases, because a rounded corner is bitten out of the
   very material a square one has:

     · corner >= R + 2, and the corner's own centre is the
       answer. It is `corner` from both edges and `corner`
       from the arc, so a button there is at least R inside
       everything, with two pixels to spare. The margin is not
       decoration: at exactly R the button is tangent to the
       boundary, which draws a hairline of it.

     · below that, and there is no room near the corner at
       all — the arc has eaten it. So go past the corner's
       disc entirely and stop where both edges are clear.

   The distance is along the diagonal, so this is one number.
   Nobody ever sees the position; what they see is that
   nothing shows when the fan is shut. */

   The scale is the original 0..100 one and the knob is
   allowed a narrow window of it: 20 to 40, which is 11px of
   gap to 16. That window is the whole of what is worth
   having — tighter and the buttons foul the corner, wider and
   they stop reading as attached to the card — so the knob
   spends all twenty of its steps inside it.

   NOT a pixel count, which it was for one revision and should
   not have been. Turning the number itself into pixels
   doubled every setting: 20 on this scale is 11px of air, and
   20 read as px is a fan sitting twice as far out as the one
   that had just been approved. The scale a value was judged

   The fan hangs outside the card, and until now it hung
   outside the block as well: the wrapper's box was the card
   and nothing else. That is right about width and wrong about
   height. The wall measures a component and pads what it
   measures, so a card reserving no vertical room of its own
   arrived as the squattest tile on the wall — 303px against
   neighbours at 364 and 424 — and the buttons the block is
   ABOUT were drawn in the tile's margin rather than in the
   block.

   So the block keeps the room the fan uses. Measured at the
   top of the Reach window and not at the current setting,
   because a box that changed size as the knob moved would
   resize its own tile on the wall while you dragged it. One
   constant, both sides, symmetrical so the card stays centred
   in the overlay.

   THE WIDTH IS UNTOUCHED, which was the whole of the old
   note: the wall scales by the LARGEST side, so a wider box
   is a smaller card. 300 across against 256 down keeps the

                lucide's git-commit-horizontal: a ring with a
                wire running out of either side of it. Which is
                what this card literally is — one step with a
                flow arriving and a flow leaving — where the
                diamond and the astroid before it were both
                shapes that STOOD FOR a step rather than
                drawing one.

                ── AND IT IS WIDER THAN THE OTHERS WERE ──────
                The glyph spans its full 24 units where those
                filled a square, so at the same nominal size it
                reads as a much lighter mark: 15 puts the ring
                at under four pixels. 18 is what gives the ring
                its weight back without the wires reaching the
                mark's own edge — measured, the glyph is 18
                across in a 30 box, so six pixels of air stay
                on each side.

                From the set rather than drawn by hand. The
                rule about not drawing marks is really a rule
                about not wearing somebody else's LOGO, and a
                shape out of the icon set the four buttons
                already use is the furthest thing from one. */}

              A "Connected" pill sat here, green dot and all, at
              the right-hand end of this row. It had already
              survived being the wrong word once — it read
              "Action", which the mark and the sentence below
              both said better — and being moved up from a row
              of its own at the foot of the card.

              It is gone because of what this block IS. The
              controls are the component; the card is the thing
              they fold into. A status pill is the loudest
              element in the header and it belongs to a node
              card that does not exist, telling you about a
              connection to nothing — furniture arguing for
              attention on a card whose whole job is to sit
              still while the corner does the work.

              The header is the mark and the name now, which is
              as much card as the demonstration needs. */}

            then had to go back for the line it was reading.

      {/* ── anchored on the card's own top-right corner ────
          Every spot above is measured from that point, so the
          fan needs no offset of its own and the arithmetic has
          one origin.

          THE FAN HANGS OUTSIDE THE BOX, which is deliberate
          and is what fixes the card looking half the size of
          every other block on the wall. The wall scales a
          component so its LARGEST side lands on 260 — so the
          air this used to reserve as padding was coming
          straight out of the card's own budget: a 375px box
          for a 288px card meant the card drew at 199 where a
          plain 300px block drew at 260.

          The buttons overflow instead. The wall's cards carry
          82px of vertical padding and centre what they hold,
          so there is room for the fan on both sides it uses,
          and the component's box is now the card and nothing
          else \u2014 which is also what centres the card in the
          tile. */}
      {/* `top: AIR`, not 0: an absolutely positioned child is
          laid against the PADDING box, so the air above pushes
          the card down and would leave the anchor behind at

          the card's corner or it is nothing. */}

             corner radius — see hideAt.

             `u` is not clamped, so the spring's overshoot

             back, rather than being flattened at the end of

                   does not need to be transparent to be
                   hidden, and a fade on something sliding out
                   of a drawer is the one cue that says it was
                   never really in there.

                   The 0.18 that is left is not concealment,
                   it is weight: a thing being pushed out
                   arrives at its full size a moment after it
                   arrives at its place, and the spring's own
                   overshoot carries the rest.

                   ── A VARIABLE, NOT THE SCALE ────────────
                   Because the hover has to grow the button
                   too, and two writers cannot share one
                   property: an inline `scale` wins over any
                   rule, so a CSS hover would have been
                   ignored. The stylesheet multiplies this by
                   its own factor and sets `scale` once from
                   both — see .nod-act, which also explains why
                   only one of the two is transitioned. */
